# Nest M.U.D

A M.U.D (multi user dungeon) with a back end API built with [`nestjs`](https://docs.nestjs.com/) and a front end UI built with [`Flutter`](https://flutter.dev/docs).

## Server

📝 _Look at what these scripts actually do before running them!_

### Setup

Attempts to install [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/), [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/), [`nestjs`](https://docs.nestjs.com/) and [`package.json`](./server/package.json) defined dependencies.

```bash
cd server
./script/setup
```

### Start

Starts a [`postgres`](https://www.postgresql.org/) database in a [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/) container, runs database migrations with [`db-migrate`](https://db-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and starts the [`nestsjs`](https://docs.nestjs.com/) API server.

```bash
cd server
./script/start
```

## TODO

Lots to do, lots to do..

- Server repositories
- Service services
- Server test data management
